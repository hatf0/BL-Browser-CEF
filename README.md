# BL-Browser-CEF
CEF version of Blockland Browser.

It is only currently compatible with Blockland v2033 (subject to change).
## Compiling
This project assumes that you have a CEF package installed at `C:/cef`.
## Injecting
This project *must* be injected very early (before engine initialization) to function properly.
